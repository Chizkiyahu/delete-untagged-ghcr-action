Action for delete containers from Github container registry

delete all / untagged ghcr containers in a repository
## Usage

<!-- start usage -->
```yaml
- name: Delete untagged ghcr
  uses: Chizkiyahu/delete-untagged-ghcr-action@v6
  with:
    # Personal access token (PAT) used to fetch the repository. The PAT is configured
    # with the local git config, which enables your scripts to run authenticated git
    # commands. The post-job step removes the PAT.
    # needs delete:packages permissions
    # required: true

    token: ${{ secrets.PAT_TOKEN }}
    # Repository name or  name with owner
    # Delete only from repository name
    # Default: ${{ github.repository }}
    repository: ''
    # 'The repository owner name'
    # Default: ${{ github.repository_owner }}
    repository_owner: ''
    # 'The package names'
    # Delete only from comma separated package names
    # required: false
    package_name: ''
    # Delete only package versions without tag
    # required: false
    # Default: true
    # choices: true, false
    untagged_only: true
    # Exclude untagged multiplatform packages from deletion
    # Manifests are usually such packages so they should be excluded
    # only for untagged_only=true
    # Default: true
    # needs docker installed
    except_untagged_multiplatform: true
    # Include signatures corresponding to deleted packages
    # without tags. Signature has the `sha256-<digest>.sig` tag where 
    # respective untagged package has `sha256:<digest>` name
    # required: false
    # default: false
    with_sigs: true
